# Instaparse pt 2 can now blur other users posts when a new user signs up.  The posts unblur once the new user creates a post.  
# The app will only show the 10 most recent photos within the last 24 hours in the server.  
# Since I was using a simulator the camera option was optional and therefore not implemented in my code.
